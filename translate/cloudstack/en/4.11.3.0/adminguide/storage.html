<h1>Storage Overview<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#storage-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>CloudStack defines two types of storage: primary and secondary. Primary
storage can be accessed by either iSCSI or NFS. Additionally, direct
attached storage may be used for primary storage. Secondary storage is
always accessed using NFS.</p>
<p>There is no ephemeral storage in CloudStack. All volumes on all nodes
are persistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="primary-storage">
<h1>Primary Storage<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#primary-storage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section gives technical details about CloudStack
primary storage. For more information about the concepts behind primary storage
see <a class="reference internal" href="../conceptsandterminology/storage_setup.html#about-primary-storage"><span class="std std-ref">Primary Storage</span></a> . For information about how to install and configure
primary storage through the CloudStack UI, see the in the Installation Guide.</p>
<div class="section" id="best-practices-for-primary-storage">
<h2>Best Practices for Primary Storage<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#best-practices-for-primary-storage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The speed of primary storage will impact guest performance. If
possible, choose smaller, higher RPM drives or SSDs for primary
storage.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There are two ways CloudStack can leverage primary storage:</p>
<p>Static: This is CloudStack’s traditional way of handling storage. In
this model, a preallocated amount of storage (ex. a volume from a
SAN) is given to CloudStack. CloudStack then permits many of its
volumes to be created on this storage (can be root and/or data
disks). If using this technique, ensure that nothing is stored on the
storage. Adding the storage to CloudStack will destroy any existing
data.</p>
<p>Dynamic: This is a newer way for CloudStack to manage storage. In
this model, a storage system (rather than a preallocated amount of
storage) is given to CloudStack. CloudStack, working in concert with
a storage plug-in, dynamically creates volumes on the storage system
and each volume on the storage system maps to a single CloudStack
volume. This is highly useful for features such as storage Quality of
Service. Currently this feature is supported for data disks (Disk
Offerings).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="runtime-behavior-of-primary-storage">
<h2>Runtime Behavior of Primary Storage<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#runtime-behavior-of-primary-storage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Root volumes are created automatically when a virtual machine is
created. Root volumes are deleted when the VM is destroyed. Data volumes
can be created and dynamically attached to VMs. Data volumes are not
deleted when VMs are destroyed.</p>
<p>Administrators should monitor the capacity of primary storage devices
and add additional primary storage as needed. See the Advanced
Installation Guide.</p>
<p>Administrators add primary storage to the system by creating a
CloudStack storage pool. Each storage pool is associated with a cluster
or a zone.</p>
<p>With regards to data disks, when a user executes a Disk Offering to
create a data disk, the information is initially written to the
CloudStack database only. Upon the first request that the data disk be
attached to a VM, CloudStack determines what storage to place the volume
on and space is taken from that storage (either from preallocated
storage or from a storage system (ex. a SAN), depending on how the
primary storage was added to CloudStack).</p>

<p>XenServer uses a clustered LVM system to store VM images on iSCSI and
Fiber Channel volumes and does not support over-provisioning in the
hypervisor. The storage server itself, however, can support
thin-provisioning. As a result the CloudStack can still support storage
over-provisioning by running on thin-provisioned storage volumes.</p>
<p>KVM supports “Shared Mountpoint” storage. A shared mountpoint is a file
system path local to each server in a given cluster. The path must be
the same across all Hosts in the cluster, for example /mnt/primary1.
This shared mountpoint is assumed to be a clustered filesystem such as
OCFS2. In this case the CloudStack does not attempt to mount or unmount
the storage as is done with NFS. The CloudStack requires that the
administrator insure that the storage is available</p>
<p>With NFS storage, CloudStack manages the overprovisioning. In this case
the global configuration parameter storage.overprovisioning.factor
controls the degree of overprovisioning. This is independent of
hypervisor type.</p>
<p>Local storage is an option for primary storage for vSphere, XenServer,
and KVM. When the local disk option is enabled, a local disk storage
pool is automatically created on each host. To use local storage for the
System Virtual Machines (such as the Virtual Router), set
system.vm.use.local.storage to true in global configuration.</p>
<p>CloudStack supports multiple primary storage pools in a Cluster. For
example, you could provision 2 NFS servers in primary storage. Or you
could provision 1 iSCSI LUN initially and then add a second iSCSI LUN
when the first approaches capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="storage-tags">
<h2>Storage Tags<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#storage-tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Storage may be “tagged”. A tag is a text string attribute associated
with primary storage, a Disk Offering, or a Service Offering. Tags allow
administrators to provide additional information about the storage. For
example, that is a “SSD” or it is “slow”. Tags are not interpreted by
CloudStack. They are matched against tags placed on service and disk
offerings. CloudStack requires all tags on service and disk offerings to
exist on the primary storage before it allocates root or data disks on
the primary storage. Service and disk offering tags are used to identify
the requirements of the storage that those offerings have. For example,
the high end service offering may require “fast” for its root disk
volume.</p>
<p>The interaction between tags, allocation, and volume copying across
clusters and pods can be complex. To simplify the situation, use the
same set of tags on the primary storage for all clusters in a pod. Even
if different devices are used to present those tags, the set of exposed
tags can be the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="maintenance-mode-for-primary-storage">
<h2>Maintenance Mode for Primary Storage<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#maintenance-mode-for-primary-storage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Primary storage may be placed into maintenance mode. This is useful, for
example, to replace faulty RAM in a storage device. Maintenance mode for
a storage device will first stop any new guests from being provisioned
on the storage device. Then it will stop all guests that have any volume
on that storage device. When all such guests are stopped the storage
device is in maintenance mode and may be shut down. When the storage
device is online again you may cancel maintenance mode for the device.
The CloudStack will bring the device back online and attempt to start
all guests that were running at the time of the entry into maintenance
mode.</p>

<div class="section" id="working-with-volumes">
<h1>Working With Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#working-with-volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A volume provides storage to a guest VM. The volume can provide for a
root disk or an additional data disk. CloudStack supports additional
volumes for guest VMs.</p>
<p>Volumes are created for a specific hypervisor type. A volume that has
been attached to guest using one hypervisor type (e.g, XenServer) may
not be attached to a guest that is using another hypervisor type, for
example:vSphere, KVM. This is because the different hypervisors use
different disk image formats.</p>
<p>CloudStack defines a volume as a unit of storage available to a guest
VM. Volumes are either root disks or data disks. The root disk has “/”
in the file system and is usually the boot device. Data disks provide
for additional storage, for example: “/opt” or “D:”. Every guest VM has
a root disk, and VMs can also optionally have a data disk. End users can
mount multiple data disks to guest VMs. Users choose data disks from the
disk offerings created by administrators. The user can create a template
from a volume as well; this is the standard procedure for private
template creation. Volumes are hypervisor-specific: a volume from one
hypervisor type may not be used on a guest of another hypervisor type.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<div class="section" id="creating-a-new-volume">
<h2>Creating a New Volume<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#creating-a-new-volume" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can add more data disk volumes to a guest VM at any time, up to the
limits of your storage capacity. Both CloudStack administrators and
users can add volumes to VM instances. When you create a new volume, it
is stored as an entity in CloudStack, but the actual storage resources
are not allocated on the physical storage device until you attach the
volume. This optimization allows the CloudStack to provision the volume
nearest to the guest that will use it when the first attachment is made.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-local-storage-for-data-volumes">
<h3>Using Local Storage for Data Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#using-local-storage-for-data-volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can create data volumes on local storage (supported with XenServer,
KVM, and VMware). The data volume is placed on the same host as the VM
instance that is attached to the data volume. These local data volumes
can be attached to virtual machines, detached, re-attached, and deleted
just as with the other types of data volume.</p>
<p>Local storage is ideal for scenarios where persistence of data volumes
and HA is not required.&nbsp;Some of the benefits include reduced disk I/O
latency and cost reduction from using inexpensive local disks.</p>
<p>In order for local volumes to be used, the feature must be enabled for
the zone.</p>
<p>You can create a data disk offering for local storage. When a user
creates a new VM, they can select this disk offering in order to cause

<h2>Resizing Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#resizing-volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CloudStack provides the ability to resize data disks; CloudStack
controls volume size by using disk offerings. This provides CloudStack
administrators with the flexibility to choose how much space they want
to make available to the end users. Volumes within the disk offerings
with the same storage tag can be resized. For example, if you only want
to offer 10, 50, and 100 GB offerings, the allowed resize should stay
within those limits. That implies if you define a 10 GB, a 50 GB and a
100 GB disk offerings, a user can upgrade from 10 GB to 50 GB, or 50 GB
to 100 GB. If you create a custom-sized disk offering, then you have the
option to resize the volume by specifying a new, larger size.</p>
<p>Additionally, using the resizeVolume API, a data volume can be moved
from a static disk offering to a custom disk offering with the size
specified. This functionality allows those who might be billing by
certain volume sizes or disk offerings to stick to that model, while
providing the flexibility to migrate to whatever custom size necessary.</p>
<p>This feature is supported on KVM, XenServer, and VMware hosts. However,
shrinking volumes is not supported on VMware hosts.</p>
<p>Before you try to resize a volume, consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The VMs associated with the volume are stopped.</li>
<li>The data disks associated with the volume are removed.</li>
<li>When a volume is shrunk, the disk associated with it is simply
truncated, and doing so would put its content at risk of data loss.
Therefore, resize any partitions or file systems before you shrink a
data disk so that all the data is moved off from that disk.</li>

<p>CloudStack supports snapshots of disk volumes. Snapshots are a
point-in-time capture of virtual machine disks. Memory and CPU states

<p>Snapshots may be taken for volumes, including both root and data disks
(except when the Oracle VM hypervisor is used, which does not support
snapshots). The administrator places a limit on the number of stored
snapshots per user. Users can create new volumes from the snapshot for
recovery of particular files and they can create templates from
snapshots to boot from a restored disk.</p>
<p>Users can create snapshots manually or by setting up automatic recurring
snapshot policies. Users can also create disk volumes from snapshots,
which may be attached to a VM like any other disk volume. Snapshots of
both root disks and data disks are supported. However, CloudStack does
not currently support booting a VM from a recovered root disk. A disk
recovered from snapshot of a root disk is treated as a regular data
disk; the data on recovered disk can be accessed by attaching the disk

<h2>Snapshot Job Throttling<a class="headerlink" href="storage.html#snapshot-job-throttling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

on the same host where the VM is running or, in the case of a stopped
VM, the host where it ran last. If many snapshots are requested for VMs
on a single host, this can lead to problems with too many snapshot jobs
overwhelming the resources of the host.</p>
<p>To address this situation, the cloud’s root administrator can throttle
how many snapshot jobs are executed simultaneously on the hosts in the
cloud by using the global configuration setting
concurrent.snapshots.threshold.perhost. By using this setting, the
administrator can better ensure that snapshot jobs do not time out and
hypervisor hosts do not experience performance issues due to hosts being
overloaded with too many snapshot requests.</p>
<p>Set concurrent.snapshots.threshold.perhost to a value that represents a
best guess about how many snapshot jobs the hypervisor hosts can execute
at one time, given the current resources of the hosts and the number of
VMs running on the hosts. If a given host has more snapshot requests,
the additional requests are placed in a waiting queue. No new snapshot
jobs will start until the number of currently executing snapshot jobs
falls below the configured limit.</p>

a snapshot request will wait in the queue. If this limit is reached, the
