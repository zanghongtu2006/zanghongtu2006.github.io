Welcome to my personal tech blog.

This is where I write about the things I build, explore, and learn — from cloud platforms and backend architecture to IoT systems, DevOps automation, digital health projects, and the challenges of becoming a developer in Germany.

I use this space to document ideas, share practical experience, and keep track of my personal projects and technical experiments.  
Sometimes the posts are deep dives into system design; sometimes they are small notes, reflections, or things I simply don’t want to forget.

I hope you find something useful or interesting here — and feel free to stop by anytime.
