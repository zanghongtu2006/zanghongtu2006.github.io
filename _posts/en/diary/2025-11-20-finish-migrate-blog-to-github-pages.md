Today I finally completed the migration of my blog to GitHub Pages.

Relearning **Jekyll**, **GitHub Pages**, and the new **workflow** feels surprisingly smooth. Everything is much more convenient than before.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without the help of **ChatGPT**. The age of AI is wonderful — the cost of learning has become incredibly low, and acquiring knowledge or skills now happens almost instantly.

Thinking back on all the countless tutorials I searched for, the fast problem-solving experiences, and the way I learned things rapidly over the years, I realize that modern education alone is no longer enough to support the AI era.  
Even if future AI no longer relies on LLMs, I still believe that AI will flatten the knowledge gap between individuals. Traditional Chinese education — which heavily relies on memorization — will collapse quickly when faced with AI.  
Yet, in my hometown, the competition based on memory is becoming even more intense, continuously eliminating students who cannot memorize fast enough.

I hope I can do something about it. Unfortunately, I have no idea where to begin.
