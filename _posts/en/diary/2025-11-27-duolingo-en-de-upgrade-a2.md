Today I completed the Duolingo English-to-German A1 courses and officially entered the A2 class.

After half a year of procrastination, I've finally started to accelerate my German learning pace.

I expect to complete A2 in one month, before Christmas.

Of course, I'll allow myself to fail a few times, as long as it's not too many.

Good Luck.
